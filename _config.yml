  I am a recent graduate of Software Engineering from The Flatiron School's self-paced program, currently looking for a full-time role as a junior software developer.
I have a background of over 10 years in culinary arts. After graduating from The Culinary Institute of America I worked as a line cook, baker, sous chef and eventually owned and operated a successful catering business.
I found a love for software development after getting burned out in the hospitality industry and decided to make a drastic career change.
